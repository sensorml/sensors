Registry of sensor and actuator descriptions in SensorML

This repository provides a registry of sensor descriptions for specific sensor models from a variety of manufacturers. When an instance of one of these sensors or actuators is deployed, the descriptions of the instance can reference one or more of these sensor model descriptions as shown in this example: http://www.sensorml.com/sensorML-2.0/examples/sensorInstance.html.

If you would like to submit sensor descriptions, please clone use the submit a Pull Request so that the instance can be validated for mistakes and recommendations.
